# Quick Start

This short guide will walk you through the basic process of using IoTDB. For a more-complete guide, please visit our website's [User Guide](https://iotdb.apache.org/#/Documents/0.10.0/chap1/sec1).

## Prerequisites

To use IoTDB, you need to have:

1. Java >= 1.8 (1.8, 11, and 13 are verified. Please make sure the environment path has been set)
2. Maven >= 3.1 (If you want to compile and install IoTDB from source code)
3. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid "too many open files" problem.

## Installation

IoTDB provides you three installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose one of them:

* Installation from source code. If you need to modify the code yourself, you can use this method.
* Installation from binary files. Download the binary files from the official website. This is the recommended method, in which you will get a binary released package which is out-of-the-box.(Comming Soon...)
* Using Dockerï¼šThe path to the dockerfile is https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile


Here in the Quick Start, we give a brief introduction of using source code to install IoTDB. For further information, please refer to Chapter 4 of the User Guide.

## Build from source

You can download the source code from:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb.git
```

Under the root path of incubator-iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Then the binary version (including both server and client) can be found at **distribution/target/apache-iotdb-{project.version}-incubating-bin.zip**

> NOTE: Directories "service-rpc/target/generated-sources/thrift" and "server/target/generated-sources/antlr3" need to be added to sources roots to avoid compilation errors in IDE.

### Configurations

configuration files are under "conf" folder

  * environment config module (`iotdb-env.bat`, `iotdb-env.sh`),
  * system config module (`tsfile-format.properties`, `iotdb-engine.properties`)
  * log config module (`logback.xml`).

For more, see [Chapter3: Server](https://iotdb.apache.org/#/Documents/progress/chap3/sec1) and [Chapter4: Client](https://iotdb.apache.org/#/Documents/progress/chap4/sec1) in detail.

## Start

You can go through the following step to test the installation, if there is no error after execution, the installation is completed.

### Start IoTDB

Users can start IoTDB by the start-server script under the sbin folder.

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-server.sh

# Windows
> sbin\start-server.bat
```


### Use IoTDB

#### Use Cli

IoTDB offers different ways to interact with server, here we introduce basic steps of using Cli tool to insrert and query data.

After installing IoTDB, there is a default user 'root', its default password is also 'root'. Users can use this
default user to login Cli to use IoTDB. The startup script of Cli is the start-client script in the folder sbin. When executing the script, user should assign
IP, PORT, USER_NAME and PASSWORD. The default parameters are "-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw -root".

Here is the command for starting the Cli:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-client.sh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root

# Windows
> sbin\start-client.bat -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

The command line client is interactive so if everything is ready you should see the welcome logo and statements:

```
 _____       _________  ______   ______
|_   _|     |  _   _  ||_   _ `.|_   _ \
  | |   .--.|_/ | | \_|  | | `. \ | |_) |
  | | / .'`\ \  | |      | |  | | |  __'.
 _| |_| \__. | _| |_    _| |_.' /_| |__) |
|_____|'.__.' |_____|  |______.'|_______/  version x.x.x


IoTDB> login successfully
IoTDB>
```

#### Basic commands for IoTDB

Now, let us introduce the way of creating timeseries, inserting data and querying data.

The data in IoTDB is organized as timeseries, in each timeseries there are some data-time pairs, and every timeseries is owned by a storage group. Before defining a timeseries, we should difine a storage group using SET STORAGE GROUP, and here is an example:

```
IoTDB> SET STORAGE GROUP TO root.ln
```

We can also use SHOW STORAGE GROUP to check created storage group:

```
IoTDB> SHOW STORAGE GROUP
+-----------------------------------+
|                      Storage Group|
+-----------------------------------+
|                            root.ln|
+-----------------------------------+
storage group number = 1
```

After the storage group is set, we can use CREATE TIMESERIES to create new timeseries. When we create a timeseries, we should define its data type and the encoding scheme. We create two timeseries as follow:

```
IoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status WITH DATATYPE=BOOLEAN, ENCODING=PLAIN
IoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE
```

Inorder to query the specific timeseries, we can use SHOW TIMESERIES <Path>. <Path> represent the path of the timeseries. Its default value is null, which means quering all the timeseries in the system(the same as using "SHOW TIMESERIES root"). Here are the examples:

1. Querying all timeseries in the system:

```
IoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES
+-------------------------------+---------------+--------+--------+
|                     Timeseries|  Storage Group|DataType|Encoding|
+-------------------------------+---------------+--------+--------+
|       root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|        root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|
|  root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|        root.ln|   FLOAT|     RLE|
+-------------------------------+---------------+--------+--------+
Total timeseries number = 2
```

2. Querying a specific timeseries(root.ln.wf01.wt01.status):

```
IoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status
+------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------+
|                    Timeseries| Storage Group|DataType|Encoding|
+------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------+
|      root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|       root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|
+------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------+
Total timeseries number = 1
```

Insert timeseries data is the basic operation of IoTDB, you can use â€˜INSERTâ€™ command to finish this. Before inserting you should assign the timestamp and the suffix path name:

```
IoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status) values(100,true);
IoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status,temperature) values(200,false,20.71)
```

The data weâ€™ve just inserted displays like this:

```
IoTDB> SELECT status FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01
+-----------------------+------------------------+
|                   Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|
+-----------------------+------------------------+
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.100|                    true|
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.200|                   false|
+-----------------------+------------------------+
Total line number = 2
```

We can also query several timeseries data at once like this:

```
IoTDB> SELECT * FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01
+-----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------+
|                   Time|  root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|
+-----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------+
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.100|                      true|                         null|
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.200|                     false|                        20.71|
+-----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------+
Total line number = 2
```

The commands to exit the Cli is:

```
IoTDB> quit
or
IoTDB> exit
```

For more on what commands are supported by IoTDB SQL, see [Chapter 5: IoTDB SQL Documentation](https://iotdb.apache.org/#/Documents/0.10.0/chap5/sec1).

### Stop IoTDB

The server can be stopped with ctrl-C or the following script:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/stop-server.sh

# Windows
> sbin\stop-server.bat
```

## Only build server

Under the root path of incubator-iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl server -am -DskipTests
```

After build, the IoTDB server will be at the folder "server/target/iotdb-server-{project.version}".


## Only build client

Under the root path of incubator-iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl client -am -DskipTests
```

After build, the IoTDB client will be at the folder "client/target/iotdb-client-{project.version}".

## Usage of import-csv.sh

### Create metadata
```
SET STORAGE GROUP TO root.fit.d1;
SET STORAGE GROUP TO root.fit.d2;
SET STORAGE GROUP TO root.fit.p;
CREATE TIMESERIES root.fit.d1.s1 WITH DATATYPE=INT32,ENCODING=RLE;
CREATE TIMESERIES root.fit.d1.s2 WITH DATATYPE=TEXT,ENCODING=PLAIN;
CREATE TIMESERIES root.fit.d2.s1 WITH DATATYPE=INT32,ENCODING=RLE;
CREATE TIMESERIES root.fit.d2.s3 WITH DATATYPE=INT32,ENCODING=RLE;
CREATE TIMESERIES root.fit.p.s1 WITH DATATYPE=INT32,ENCODING=RLE;
```
